<h2>Addendum: Unicode</h2>
<p>Unicode is kind of tough to grasp. It’s a collection of ‘code points’ that
represent all the known characters in use in modern language, whether it’s
the western alphabet, or Asian kana systems. The concept of code points is
really irrelevant to our discussions. The most important thing is that a
Unicode string is capable of representing any character in any syllabary we
have a font for.</p>
<p>The thing is, having this kind of flexibility requires a lot of space. In
good old ASCII, letters are any one of 52 numbers, both upper and lower
case. Add in other symbols on the keyboard, a few symbols _not_ on the
keyboard, and still everything fits in a single byte. Each character only
needed a single byte to represent it. A string of 30 characters needed 30
bytes total to store.</p>
<p>With Unicode, there are 1,114,112 code points, usually represented by 4
bytes per character. This means in Unicode, a 30 character string needs 120
bytes for storage. Generally, Unicode is not a good way to _store_ text,
although it’s a great way to represent text in general.</p>
<p>Typically, you won’t need all 1 million code points in any given text, so
encodings exist that allow us to store text and optimize for a particular
subset of the code points. When we need to share text between components, we
need to take our encoded text and decode it back into Unicode before
sending it back.</p>
<p>In our scenario, a text file is encoded in the ‘latin-1’ encoding, to allow
us to use an accent mark in our movie titles. Some databases, on the
other hand, expect to receive Unicode strings from our python code, so we
need to decode from latin-1 back into Unicode:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">title</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">decode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;latin-1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After this, our ‘title’ variable is a string that stores data as Unicode
code points, and can be safely passed off to our database.</p>
